; DLSSTweaks by emoose - https://github.com/emoose/DLSSTweaks
; Wrapper DLL that can force DLAA onto DLSS-supported games, along with tweaking the scaling ratios & presets used by them
;
; DLSSTweaks now offers two ways of loading itself in, to help with systems that had issues with the older method:
;
; - Leaving the DLL filename as "nvngx.dll" will let it wrap the nvngx.dll DLSS module, usually has the best chance of working since it requires less code hooks to be installed.
;   However this method does need a registry change to be applied first to stop DLSS from checking the nvngx.dll signature.
;   The included "EnableNvidiaSigOverride.reg" file can handle this for you, just double-click -> Run -> Yes to all prompts
;   (This only affects Nvidia specific signature checks, not anything to do with Windows)
;   In case it wasn't included, reg file can also be found at https://github.com/emoose/DLSSTweaks/blob/master/EnableNvidiaSigOverride.reg
;
; - Alternatively, a legacy method can be used by renaming the DLSSTweaks "nvngx.dll" to one of the following names instead.
;   (different games may require certain filenames to load in properly, and some games may have issues with this method altogether, the nvngx.dll method above is recommended)
;   - XInput1_3.dll
;   - XInput1_4.dll
;   - XInput9_1_0.dll
;   - dxgi.dll
;   - XAPOFX1_5.dll
;   - X3DAudio1_7.dll
;   - winmm.dll
;
; If you find a DLSS-supported game that doesn't work with either of these methods please let me know!

[DLSS]
; ForceDLAA: forces all DLSS quality modes to act as DLAA instead, making the game render in full-res while DLAA anti-aliasing is applied over it
;  To use this just enable any DLSS quality in the game, with this tweak enabled they'll all render at full resolution instead
;  The game might change mip biasing depending on the quality level however, so feel free to experiment with them!
;
;  Notes:
;  - if DLSSQualityLevels section is enabled then ForceDLAA won't be applied, and ratios will be used from that section instead
;  - you can check if DLAA is active using the OverrideDlssHud tweak below, overlay text should mention both render resolution & upscaled resolution, if they match then DLAA is active
;  - if game has problems running with full-res DLAA it could be worth tweaking the ResolutionOffset setting in Compatibility section below
;  - DLSS Preset F is recommended for use with DLAA by Nvidia, but usually won't be set by default, instead you can set that in the DLSSPresets section below
ForceDLAA = false

; OverrideAutoExposure: allows forcing DLSS auto-exposure to be enabled/disabled/left at default
;  Certain DLSS2 titles may have an "AutoExposure" option in-game, which might fail to activate with DLSS3.1
;  In that case you can force it to enable here
;  Some early titles released before auto-exposure might also benefit from having it forced (reducing ghosting issues in certain titles)
;  More info about auto-exposure at https://github.com/emoose/DLSSTweaks/issues/53
;  Set to 0 to leave it at default, 1 to force enable, or -1 to force disable
OverrideAutoExposure = 0

; OverrideDlssHud: allows force enabling/disabling the DLSS debug display HUD overlay
;  The HUD will display on bottom left of screen in-game when enabled, though some titles may draw effects on top of it
;  For those it's recommended to try disabling any post-process effects
;  Should work with both release & dev DLSS DLL types
;  Set to 0 to leave it at default, 1 to force enable, or -1 to force disable
;  (if overlay doesn't seem to draw try setting this to 2 instead to make it use a slightly different method)
OverrideDlssHud = 0

; DisableDevWatermark: removes the on-screen watermark shown when using dev DLL
;  Can also remove watermark on certain versions of DLSSG/FrameGeneration
;  Only useful if you're using a dev version of DLSS, most won't need this
DisableDevWatermark = false

; VerboseLogging: increases DLSSTweaks log level & prints extra log entries into dlsstweaks.log file
VerboseLogging = false

[DLLPathOverrides]
; DLLPathOverrides: allows overriding the path that a DLL will be loaded from based on the filename of it
;  This can be useful if you're prevented somehow from changing any of the game files, stopping you from changing DLSS DLLs easily
;  (eg. RGL launcher which always overwrites DLSS with an older version)
;  Can also be useful if you use a global injector setup & want every game to use a single DLSS DLL
;
;  Format of this section is the following:
;  (";" indicates the line is a comment, remove it for DLSSTweaks to use that line)
;[DLL name] = [path to load from]
;  For example:
;nvngx_dlss = nvngx_dlss_new.dll
;
;  Full paths can also be specified too, including spaces (no need to use double-quotes around it):
;nvngx_dlss = C:\Users\Username\Desktop\DLSS Releases\3.1.11\rel\nvngx_dlss.dll
;
;  Other DLLs such as DLSS FrameGen (nvngx_dlssg) can also be overridden using this too:
;nvngx_dlssg = C:\Users\Username\Desktop\DLSS Releases\DLSS FrameGen\3.1.10\nvngx_dlssg.dll

[DLSSQualityLevels]
; DLSSQualityLevels: allows overriding the ratios that DLSS uses for each quality level
;  Note that enabling this section will disable the ForceDLAA setting above
Enable = false

; Ratios/multipliers applied to each axis of screen resolution
; Set to 1.0 to force this quality level to use full resolution (ie. DLAA)
; Values are limited to range 0.0 - 1.0
UltraPerformance = 0.33333334
Performance = 0.5
Balanced = 0.58
Quality = 0.66666667

; UltraQuality: certain games may allow this to be chosen if uncommented (remove the ";" at the start) and set to non-zero value
;  Very few titles actually allow using this though, but a small few may show an option for it once enabled, giving you an extra DLSS level to choose from
;UltraQuality = 0.77

[DLSSPresets]
; DLSS preset overrides for each quality level: set to Default to leave the preset set to whatever game/DLSS decided for it
;  Or set to A / B / C / D / F to try forcing that preset instead.
;  Presets were added in DLSS 3.1, these are essentially the different kinds of DLSS 2.x DLL versions, all merged into 3.1 as these presets
;  (so eg. instead of picking the best quality DLSS DLL for your game, you'd just find the right preset for it instead)
;  For descriptions of each preset see https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/10z2ra9/nvidia_publishes_dlss_super_resolution_sdk_31/j81f9te/
;  (OverrideAppId should no longer be needed to use this section, any overrides should just work without needing anything else enabled)
;  (in case the presets here aren't being applied for you the OverrideAppId tweak can still be enabled in Compatibility section below)

DLAA = Default
Quality = Default
Balanced = Default
Performance = Default
UltraPerformance = Default

[Compatibility]
; ResolutionOffset: offsets both resolution axes by this value when DLAA is being applied
;  Some games might not function well with full-resolution DLAA for whatever reason
;  Subtracting a tiny amount from the resolution first may help with them though
;  This offset is only applied to DLAA modes (either from ForceDLAA, DLSSQualityLevels 1.00, or the game setting DLAA itself)
;  Titles known to require this for DLAA to work:
; - RE Engine titles (set to -1)
; - Crysis 3 Remastered (set to -1)
ResolutionOffset = 0

; DisableIniMonitoring: if set to true, prevents DLSSTweaks from checking for updated INI during gameplay
;  By default DLSSTweaks will ask Windows to be notified whenever the INI file is updated, and will then try applying any updated settings to the game during runtime
;  Not every setting can be applied during gameplay though, most will require game to be relaunched, depends on the game which settings can be changed
;  (DLSSPresets should work on almost every title though - you can use OverrideDlssHud to confirm)
;
;  INI monitoring should have almost no cost to performance, but may possibly cause issues with certain games depending how they're installed
;  In case game fails to launch with DLSSTweaks in place, you can try disabling the INI update code here
DisableIniMonitoring = false

; OverrideAppId: previously this was required to be set in order to override DLSS3.1 presets on certain games
;  However in newer DLSSTweaks a different solution has been found, which can now let presets be overridden without needing any app ID changes
;  That method could stop working on future titles/DLSS versions though
;  So in case game doesn't seem to apply DLSSPresets section for you at all, you can try seeing if OverrideAppId can still help
;  (in majority of cases this likely won't be needed however)
OverrideAppId = false
